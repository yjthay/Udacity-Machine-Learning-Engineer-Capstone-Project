Similarly, if a sell signal is generated, we will use a similar method to classify true negatives adn false negatives.

This will mainly be carried out in Python and will involve ensuring consistency in the data for interpretation at a later stage.  I will look to download the data via the Bloomberg API.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "            a) However, one has to be mindful of various issues such as different listing dates (e.g. a constituenting company might have been listed for less than the 500 trading days window that we are looking at). \n",
    "        \n",
    "            b) Also there are issues such as trading halts etc on the name pending news release or merger and acquisitions that might result in a particular ticker name changing etc.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    All of these are important information will have result in unintended skewing of our model and thus introduce bias into the result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) This will be the stage of data exploration where I will be spending time to explore the structure of the data.  This involves plotting the distributions of various variables that are of intuitive importance as well as looking at the various correlations of the variables in the data.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            a) This stage will focus on visualisation of the underlying data set to see if there are any interesting relationship between the various variables.  This step will also be incredibly useful in spotting results that are outliers given that it gives us perspective of where the data are with respect to other equivalent data points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Next I will embark on processing the data.  This means to refining the data and creating new variables that are normalised or creating data that describe the data better such as ratios.  It is also important in cleaning out dirty data as well as removal of outliers that might lead to unintended behaviour in our model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "            a) I will look to scale and normalise the data using the Min-Max Scaling but if there are unforeseen implications of it, I will revert to using the traditional method of subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            b) The next step of data cleaning involve converting all the data into the most suitable format.  This is especially so when we are looking at dates.  \"20/02/2018\" will coming after \"10/03/2018\" if we sort the data when the date is recognised as a string.  This poses a huge issue as we require the data to be in chronological order.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            c) Lastly, with regards to outliers, I will look if it impacts our inference or relationship between other data points.  This is important as outliers might be leading indicators that can help us to more efficienctly generate signals.  If data point is missing, I will look to fill it in with the nearest neighbours or the mean to ensure that we minimise any unintentional skewing of the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4) I will look to built the neural network and different layers of it using Python Keras module and train the model.  I will specifically set a subset of results aside for testing the model and will not use it for any training.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "            a) I would expect the relationship of various features to be non-linearly separable along the 13 dimentions thus I would expect to use at least a single layer of hidden layer. Tentatively, I will expect to create the first layer of dense layer which will output a layer of 156 variables which I will then use a max pooling layer of 32 filters with a pooling size of 2. This will half the number of variables and thereafter, I will look to add the convulation layer before applying Global Average Pooling as the next layer.  To avoid overfitting, we have a layer of dropouts where 20% of the samples are randomly dropped so as to allow the model to be more robust.  Lastly, I will have a Dense layer that will output the result of the result.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            b) I will also look to use transfer learning.  I will look at the creating a model using the first share and then adapt the neural network to a new different data set based off a second share.  This is especially useful our case where we have large data set and the result are very similar. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792.pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5) Once the results are in place, I will have to structure a report so as to correctly reflect the analysis that has gone through the whole project and ensure that it is properly explained and sufficiently rigorous in methodology."
